2. Temporarily remove these heros: Alchemist, Antimage, Spectre. 
3. Get Chen back.
4. Optimized the Captian Mode. Now if you let Bots to ban/pick, they will try to ban/pick with the same hero pool as in AP mode, and will pick in this order: Offlaner, support1, midlaner,support2,safelane carry. I also try to let them have a 311 distribution, like professional game(If the feedback is bad,it's easy to go back to 212).
Two important things:a.If you are the captain, please follow the Offlaner, support1, midlaner,support2,safelane carry order to pick! The bots will only go to the right place in this case. b.In some extreme cases bots will pick two same heros(I tested 15 games, one occurs). If that happened, just quit and start another game...
5. Now bots will be laning more peacefully in the first 6-7 minutes without frequent team fight in mid lane.
6. The following heros are either in item building, ability usage or bug fixed: Batrider, Centaur, Chen, Death prophet, Disruptor, Dragon kignt, Faceless void, Huskar, jakiro, Juggernaut, Legion commander, Leshrac, Lina, Luna, Mirana, Necrolyte, Phantom assassin, Pudge, Riki, Sniper, Sven, Tidehunter, Tiny, Treant, Undying, Windrunner, Zeus.
7. Fixed some bugs.
